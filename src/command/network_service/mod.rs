/// **NOTES:**
/// - **TOBY-L4 / LARA-R2 / TOBY-R2** - The +CSQ utilization is deprecated. It
///   is warmly recommended to use the command +CESQ to obtain the same
///   information more accurately.

///   LISA-U1 / SARA-G4 / SARA-G3 / LEON-G1** - The radio signal strength
///   <`signal_power`> will be also used to build and display the indicator
///   "signal" i.e. signal quality in the information text response of +CIND and
///   in the +CIEV URC (see the +CMER command description).
///
/// In dedicated mode, during the radio channel reconfiguration (e.g. handover),
/// invalid measurements may be returned for a short transitory because the MT
/// must compute them on the newly assigned channel.
/// Returns the received signal quality and level:
/// - If the current serving cell is not a GERAN cell, the <rxlev> and <ber> parameters are set to value 99
/// - If the current serving cell is not a UTRA FDD cell, the <rscp> and the <ecn0> parameters are set to 255
/// - If the current serving cell is not an E-UTRA cell, the <rsrq> and <rsrp> parameters are set to 255.
///
/// The Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) is a LTE specific measure that averages the power received
/// on the subcarriers carrying the reference signal. The RSRP measurement bandwidth is equivalent to a
/// single LTE subcarrier: its value is therefore much lower than the total received power usually referred
/// to as RSSI. In LTE the RSSI depends on the currently allocated bandwidth, which is not pre-determined.
/// Therefore the RSSI is not useful to describe the signal level in the cell.

/// By means of <PreferredAct> and <2ndPreferredAct> parameters it is possible
/// to define the order of RAT selection at boot or when entering full
/// functionality from de-registered state. If <SelectedAcT> is set to dual or
/// tri mode, it is possible to specify the preferred RAT parameter
/// <PreferredAct>, which determines which RAT is selected first. If the
/// preferred RAT parameter is omitted, it will be set by default to the highest
/// RAT in the current multi-mode range. If tri mode is selected, it is also
/// possible to specify a second preferred RAT <2ndPreferredAct> in addition to
/// the preferred RAT. This parameter determines which RAT is selected if no
/// cellular service can be obtained by the module on the preferred RAT. The
/// remaining RAT will be selected when no service can be obtained in the
/// preferred one(s).
///
/// **NOTES:**
/// - Any change in the RAT selection must be done deregistered state, entered
///   by issuing the AT+CFUN=0 or AT+CFUN=4 AT command. Use AT+CFUN=1 to return
///   to the module full functionality.
/// - **SARA-U2 / LISA-U2 / LISA-U1** - See Notes for the procedure to enter the
///   detach state.
/// - u-blox cellular modules are certified according to all the capabilities
///   and options stated in the Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement
///   document (PICS) of the module. The PICS, according to 3GPP TS 51.010-2
///   [66], 3GPP TS 34.121-2 [67], 3GPP TS 36.521-2 [94] and 3GPP TS 36.523-2
///   [95], is a statement of the implemented and supported capabilities and
///   options of a device. If the user changes the command settings during the
///   certification process, the PICS of the application device integrating a
///   u-blox cellular module must be changed accordingly.
/// - **TOBY-L4 / TOBY-L2 / MPCI-L2 / LARA-R2 / TOBY-R2 / SARA-U2 / LISA-U2 /
///   LISA-U1** - In dual mode and tri mode, all the requested Access Stratum
///   protocols are active and Inter-RAT measurements as well as Inter-RAT
