//! ### 20 - GPIO Commands
//! The section describes the AT commands used to configure the GPIO pins provided by u-blox cellular modules
//! ### GPIO functions
//! On u-blox cellular modules, GPIO pins can be opportunely configured as general purpose input or output.
//! Moreover GPIO pins of u-blox cellular modules can be configured to provide custom functions via +UGPIOC
//! AT command. The custom functions availability can vary depending on the u-blox cellular modules series and
//! version: see Table 53 for an overview of the custom functions supported by u-blox cellular modules. \
//! The configuration of the GPIO pins (i.e. the setting of the parameters of the +UGPIOC AT command) is saved
//! in the NVM and used at the next power-on.
