//! ### 18 - Packet Switched Data Services Commands
//!
//! A PDP context can be either primary or secondary. In LTE, PS data
//! connections are referred to as EPS bearers: EPS bearers are conceptually
//! equivalent to the legacy PDP contexts, which are often referred to for sake
//! of simplicity. Similarly to a PDP context, the EPS bearer can be a default
//! (primary) or dedicated (secondary) one. The initial EPS bearer established
//! during LTE attach procedure is actually a default EPS bearer. A secondary
//! PDP context uses the same IP address of a primary PDP context (the usual PDP
//! context activated e.g. via dial-up). The Traffic Flow Filters for such
//! secondary contexts shall be specified according to 3GPP TS 23.060
//!
//! The typical usage of the secondary PDP contexts is in `VoIP` calls, where RTP
//! (speech) packets are conveyed on one PDP context (e.g. the primary one) with
//! a given `QoS` (e.g. low reliability) whereas SIP signalling is routed on a
//! different PDP context (e.g. the secondary one, with the same IP address but
//! different port numbers) with a more reliable `QoS`.
//!
//! A Traffic Flow Template (i.e. a filter based on port number, specifying
//! relative flow precedence) shall be configured for the secondary context to
//! instruct the GGSN to route down-link packets onto different `QoS` flows
//! towards the TE.
